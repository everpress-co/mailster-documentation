On the form settings page you can define how your form should work.

?>Test this page on [our demo](https://demo.mailster.co/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=newsletter&page=mailster_forms&ID=1&tab=settings).

### Form Options

##### Fill fields with known data if user is logged in

If the user is logged in Mailster tries to prefill the form fields.

##### Redirect after submit

##### Allow users to update their data with this form

If people who are already registered submit this form they will just update their information.

If this option is checked Mailster will use this form and it's settings for the Profile where users can update their subscriptions.

You can decide if users can decide to which lists they sign up to.

If you choose to **Assign new lists automatically to this form** Mailster will add new created lists to this form automatically.

### Double/Single Opt in

While Double opt in is required by law in many countries (GDPR!) you can switch to single opt in here.
