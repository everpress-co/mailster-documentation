| Usage Tracking       | Enable usage tracking for your site. If you enable this option we are able to track the usage of Mailster on your site.

Tracking is completely optional and can be disabled anytime. |
| Cache                | If enabled Mailster doesn't use cache anymore. This causes an increase in page load time!
