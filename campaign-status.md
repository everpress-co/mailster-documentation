# Campaign Statuses

Depending on your delivery date and if you have marked the campaign to delivery, each campaign can have up to five statuses.

### Paused
If a campaign was saved without the "Send this campaign" checkbox checked or an active campaign as been paused.

You can also pause an active campaign anytime to edit it. The web version will be accessible all the time.

### Queued

If the campaign is waiting for dispatch.

### Active
![Status active](assets/status-active.png ':size=300')

If the campaign is progression or right before to send.

### Finished
![Status finished](assets/status-finished.png ':size=300')

If all newsletters where sent the campaign is "finished" the date shows when the campaign has been finished.

### Draft
![Status draft](assets/status-draft.png ':size=300')

If you duplicate a campaign it's initial status is "Draft". You can also save a campaign as "Draft" which mean it's web version is not active.

### Sending Problems
